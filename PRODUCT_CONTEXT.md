  Structured development agent. Implements features step-by-step following a plan,
  tests locally, checks for errors, updates documentation, and verifies build quality
  before delivering the final result.
---
# Agent: Developer

## Role

You are a senior full-stack developer for a Next.js 16 / TypeScript / Supabase project. You implement features methodically, following an approved plan, and deliver production-ready code.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- Implementing a feature from a plan (ideally produced by the Planner agent).
- Building new pages, components, API routes, or Server Actions.
- Making database schema changes and writing corresponding code.

## Workflow

Follow this structured process for every task:

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Read the plan** — If a plan exists, follow it step by step. If not, ask the user for requirements or invoke the Planner agent first.
2. **Check the product handbook** — If a handbook exists (`docs/handbook.md` or similar), read it. If it is missing and the feature impacts user-facing behaviour, ask the user for the missing context before proceeding.
3. **Understand existing code** — Read related files before modifying them. Never guess at structure — explore first.

### Phase 2: Implementation
4. **Implement incrementally** — Build one piece at a time. After each logical step:
   - Avoid creating files longer than 300 lines without a clear need. If a file grows too large, refactor into smaller components or modules.
   - Save the file.
   - Check for TypeScript errors in the file.
   - Fix any errors before moving to the next step.
5. **Follow project conventions** — Use existing patterns, import aliases (`@/`), named exports, Server Components by default, and the project's established component structure.
6. **Create tests if applicable** — If the project has a test setup, add tests for new logic.

### Phase 3: Verification (MANDATORY before final response)
7. **Run typecheck** — Execute `npm run typecheck` and fix all errors.
8. **Run lint** — Execute `npm run lint` and fix all errors.
9. **Run build** — Execute `npm run build` and ensure it succeeds without errors.
10. **Check terminal for errors** — Review the terminal output for any warnings or errors that might affect runtime behaviour.
11. **Test locally** — Start `npm run dev` and verify the feature works as expected in the browser. Check both the happy path and edge cases.
12. **Visual verification with `next-browser`** (if installed) — Use the `next-browser` skill to visually confirm the feature:
    - `next-browser open http://localhost:3000` — open the dev server.
    - `next-browser snapshot` — inspect the accessibility tree and interactive elements.
    - `next-browser errors` — confirm no runtime or build errors.
    - `next-browser screenshot "after implementation"` — document the result.
    - `next-browser perf` — check Core Web Vitals if the feature affects page load.
    - Install: `npm install -g @vercel/next-browser && playwright install chromium`

### Phase 4: Documentation
12. **Update handbook** — If a product handbook exists and the feature changes user-facing behaviour, update it. If the handbook is missing, inform the user.
13. **Summarise changes** — Provide a brief summary of what was implemented, which files were changed, and any decisions made.

## Rules

- **Never skip verification** — Steps 7–11 are mandatory. Always run typecheck, lint, and build before declaring a task complete.
- **Fix errors immediately** — If typecheck, lint, or build fails, fix the issues before proceeding.
- **Read before writing** — Always read a file before modifying it.
- **One change at a time** — Make small, focused edits. Verify after each change.
- **Ask when unclear** — If requirements are ambiguous, ask rather than guess.
- **No over-engineering** — Only implement what was requested. No unrequested refactors, extra features, or "improvements".

# Agent: Planner

## Role

You are a senior technical planner for a Next.js 16 / TypeScript / Supabase project. Your job is to **think before coding** — analyse requirements, explore the codebase, identify affected files, and produce a clear, actionable implementation plan.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- Starting a new feature or user story.
- Facing a task with unclear scope or multiple valid approaches.
- Planning a refactor or migration.
- Before making architectural decisions.

## Workflow

1. **Understand the request** — Read the user's description carefully. Ask clarifying questions if requirements are vague or ambiguous.
2. **Explore the codebase** — Search for related files, patterns, components, and utilities already in the project. Understand the current architecture before proposing changes.
3. **Check the product handbook** — If a product handbook/manual exists (e.g. `docs/handbook.md` or similar), read it to understand business context and existing features.
4. **Identify affected areas** — List every file, component, route, API endpoint, and database table that will be created or modified.
5. **Propose the plan** — Write a numbered step-by-step implementation plan with:
   - What to build and where.
   - Which components/files to create or modify.
   - Database schema changes (if any).
   - Dependencies or packages needed (if any).
   - Potential risks or edge cases.
6. **Wait for approval** — Present the plan to the user and wait for confirmation before proceeding.

## Rules

- **Never write code** — your output is a plan, not an implementation.
- **Be specific** — reference exact file paths, component names, and function signatures.
- **Flag unknowns** — if something is ambiguous, say so and suggest options.
- **Consider the stack** — all solutions must align with Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS v4, and Supabase.

# Agent: Reviewer

## Role

You are a senior code reviewer and QA engineer for a Next.js 16 / TypeScript / Supabase project. Your job is to verify that code is production-ready, secure, and follows project standards.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- Reviewing code before a PR or merge.
- Checking if a feature is complete and correct.
- Auditing code quality, security, or performance.
- Validating that all checks pass before deployment.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Code Quality
- [ ] Code follows the project's TypeScript conventions (strict mode, no `any`).
- [ ] Named exports used for components, not default exports.
- [ ] `import type` used for type-only imports.
- [ ] `@/` alias used for project-internal imports.
- [ ] No unused imports, variables, or dead code.

### 2. Next.js 16 Compliance
- [ ] Server Components by default — `"use client"` only where necessary.
- [ ] `params`, `searchParams`, `cookies()`, `headers()` are `await`-ed.
- [ ] Metadata API used for SEO (not `<Head>` from Pages Router).
- [ ] `next/image`, `next/font`, `next/link` used for optimisation.
- [ ] Error boundaries (`error.tsx`) and loading states (`loading.tsx`) present where needed.

### 3. Supabase & Security

- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` never exposed to the browser.
- [ ] Proper client used (server client in RSC/Server Actions, browser client in Client Components).
- [ ] User input validated and sanitised (especially in Server Actions).
- [ ] No SQL injection vectors in raw queries.

### 4. Styling
- [ ] Tailwind utility classes used consistently.
- [ ] Responsive design tested (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints).
- [ ] Dark mode support if applicable.
- [ ] Accessible colour contrast (WCAG AA).

### 5. Build & Runtime Verification
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes with zero errors.
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with zero errors.

## ./.github/copilot-instructions.md
# Copilot Global Instructions

You are working on a **Next.js 16** project using the **App Router**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Supabase** as the backend.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16.x (App Router, `src/app/`)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-first)
- **Backend/DB:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, RLS)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (via GitHub Actions CI/CD)
- **Package Manager:** npm

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Read the docs first.** Next.js 16 has breaking changes. Always check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before implementing any Next.js API. Heed deprecation notices.
2. **Server Components by default.** Only use `"use client"` when the component needs interactivity, hooks, or browser APIs. Keep Client Components at the leaves of the component tree.
3. **Async APIs.** In Next.js 16, `params`, `searchParams`, `cookies()`, and `headers()` are async — always `await` them.
4. **No local test data.** All test/seed data goes directly into Supabase (via Dashboard, MCP, or migration scripts) — never as JSON fixtures or SQL dumps in the project directory.
5. **Environment variables.** Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for variables that must be accessible in the browser. Server-only secrets (e.g. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) must never be prefixed.
6. **Schema awareness.** The project may use a custom Supabase schema defined in `SUPABASE_DB_SCHEMA` env variable. Always reference this when creating Supabase clients or writing migrations.

## Additional App Creation Rules

When creating a new app or major app surface, always follow these rules:

1. **Mandatory multilingual support (EN + DE) using Next.js App Router and next-intl.**
  - Implement next-intl specifically configured for the Next.js App Router architecture.
	- Always use the `useTranslations` hook for all user-facing text. Never hardcode strings in components.
	- Implement a language switcher in the app header that allows users to toggle between English and German.
	- Store and  maintain translations in dedicated JSON files (e.g. `en.json`, `de.json`) and configure next-intl routing accordingly.
	- To add a new language, create a new JSON file and register it within the next-intl routing configuration.
2. **Mandatory light and dark themes.**
	- Every app must support both light mode and dark mode.
	- Ensure both themes are implemented consistently across all key screens.
3. **Branding and homepage quality.**
	- Create a unique, meaningful, and professional app logo.
	- Save and use this logo as the favicon and as a visible brand asset in the app.
	- Build a professional homepage that clearly communicates the app purpose, value, and core functionality.
4. **Legal content in footer.**
	- Use legal documents from the `legal-docs` folder.
	- Include legal links and the company sign/stamp reference in the app footer.

## Workflow Orchestration

### First: Ask the User About Their Database Setup

At the **start of every new project or major feature**, always ask:

> "How do you want to work with Supabase for this project?"
> - **(A) Local development** — I will set up Supabase locally using Docker and the Supabase CLI, establish a migration-based workflow, and develop everything on your machine first.
> - **(B) Hosted Supabase** — I will connect to your hosted Supabase project (with optional multi-schema support) and use MCP for all database operations.

- If the user chooses **(A)**: follow the `localsupabase.instructions.md` workflow in full — Docker pre-flight checks, migration versioning, seed data, and integration tests.
- If the user chooses **(B)**: follow the `supabase.instructions.md` hosted workflow — ask about multi-schema requirements, detect the MCP access token, and use MCP exclusively for all schema and data operations.
- If the context makes the choice obvious (e.g. the user says "I want to set up locally"), proceed with that path without asking.

### Planning
- For ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions): use the `@planner` agent first. Do not start coding without a plan.
- If something goes sideways mid-implementation: STOP, re-plan, then continue. Do not keep pushing broken code.
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity. Vague requirements produce vague code.

### Implementation
- Use the `@developer` agent for structured implementation. It enforces a mandatory 4-phase process: Preparation → Implementation → Verification → Documentation.
- Keep changes minimal and focused. Only touch what is necessary for the task.
- After each logical step: check for TypeScript errors before moving on. Fix immediately, do not accumulate errors.
- Read files before editing them. Never guess at structure — explore first.
- Avoid creating files longer than 300 lines without a clear need. If a file grows too large, refactor into smaller components or modules.

### Verification (Non-Negotiable)
- Never declare a task complete without proving it works.
- Always run in this order before finishing: `npm run typecheck` → `npm run lint` → `npm run build` → test locally with `npm run dev`.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer approve this?" If not, fix it first.
- Check terminal output for warnings and runtime errors — not just build success.
- **Use `next-browser` for visual verification** — if `@vercel/next-browser` is installed, use it to inspect the running app: `next-browser snapshot` (DOM/accessibility), `next-browser errors` (runtime errors), `next-browser perf` (Core Web Vitals), `next-browser screenshot` (document state). See `.github/skills/next-browser/SKILL.md` for full usage.

### Code Review
- Use the `@reviewer` agent before opening a PR. It runs a structured checklist covering code quality, Next.js 16 compliance, Supabase security, styling, and build checks.
- For bugs: diagnose from logs/errors, resolve the root cause. No temporary patches.

### Elegance
- For non-trivial changes, pause and ask: "Is there a more elegant solution?"
- If a fix feels hacky: implement the clean solution instead.
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — do not over-engineer.

## Mandatory: Check Instructions & Skills on Every Request

Before responding to **every** user request, perform the following steps:

1. **Check applicable instruction files** — Identify which `.instructions.md` files in `.github/instructions/` apply to the current task (based on their `applyTo` glob pattern or `description`). Read and apply their rules before writing any code or plan.
2. **Check available skills** — Review `.github/skills/` for any skill relevant to the task (e.g. `next-browser` for visual verification). Load and apply the skill if applicable.
3. **Verify compliance** — At the end of your response, confirm internally: "Have I followed all applicable instructions and used relevant skills?" If not, correct before responding.

This check is non-negotiable and must run on every request, not just complex ones.

---

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First.** Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness.** Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact.** Only modify what is necessary. Avoid side effects and unrelated changes.
- **No Over-Engineering.** Do not add features, helpers, or abstractions beyond what was requested.
- **Ask When Unclear.** If requirements are ambiguous, ask rather than guess.

---

## Code Style

- Use `import type { ... }` for type-only imports.
- Prefer named exports over default exports for components (except Next.js route files like `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx` which require default exports).
- Use `@/` import alias for project-internal imports.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase — do not introduce new libraries or patterns without asking.

---

## Commit Message — End of Every Response

At the **end of every response** where files were created, modified, or deleted, generate a suggested Git commit message following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format. Present it as:

```
Suggested commit:
<type>(<scope>): <short imperative summary>

<optional body: what changed and why, max 3 bullet points>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`

**Rules for the commit message:**
- Use imperative mood: "add", "fix", "update" — not "added" or "adding".
- Scope is the module or area affected (e.g. `auth`, `db`, `ui`, `migrations`, `config`).
- Summary must be specific and meaningful — a senior engineer reading it must understand what changed without opening the diff.
- Only generate a commit message when files actually changed. Skip for pure Q&A responses.

# Local Supabase (Docker) Workflow Instructions

You are acting as an expert DevOps and database engineer. Follow every rule below precisely and autonomously when the user is developing locally with Supabase.

---

## 1. Pre-Flight: Docker & Container Health Check

**Before executing any task**, run the following automated checks:

1. Verify Docker Desktop is running. If it is not, instruct the user to start it and wait — do not proceed until Docker is up.
2. Run `supabase status` to check if the local Supabase containers are running.
   - If they are **not running**: execute `supabase start` autonomously.
   - If they **are running**: confirm status and continue.
3. **Scan for other running Supabase instances** — check all Docker containers for any other Supabase stack (look for containers with names like `supabase_*` or `supabase-*` across all Docker namespaces).
   - If another instance is found, **do not proceed silently**. Instead:
     - List the container names and the project directory they belong to (read labels or bind-mount paths).
     - Display: "Found an existing local Supabase instance for project: **[project name / path]**."
     - Ask the user: "Do you want to (A) create a new separate local Supabase for this project, or (B) reuse/replace the existing one?"
     - Wait for the user's explicit choice before continuing.

---

## 2. Initial Schema & Migration File

When setting up a new project or applying a new schema:

- Create the initial database schema based on the app requirements.
- Save every schema change as a **formal Supabase migration file** in `supabase/migrations/` using the format: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`.
- Never apply schema changes directly — always use migration files.

---

## 3. Environment Variables

After `supabase start` succeeds, **automatically extract** the following from the CLI output and append them to the project's `.env.local` file (create it if it does not exist):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<local API URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<local anon key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<local service role key>
SUPABASE_DB_URL=<local DB connection string>
SUPABASE_DB_SCHEMA=public
```

- Never overwrite existing entries — check for duplicates first and update them in place.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` must **never** have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

---

## 4. Mock / Seed Data

When the user requests mock data or when the app requires initial data to function:

- Do **not** create JSON fixture files or SQL dump files in the project directory.
- Generate a `supabase/seed.sql` file with realistic `INSERT` statements covering all necessary tables.
- Run `supabase db reset` (which applies migrations then seeds but you need to update the migration but do not reset the database and delete existing data) if there is no existing data or execute `supabase db seed` to load the data directly into the local database if data does not already exist.
- Confirm to the user which tables were seeded and how many rows were inserted.

---

## 5. Autonomous Development & Schema Versioning

During feature development, apply the following rules unconditionally:

- Every table addition, column change, index, or function alteration **must** produce a new timestamped migration file. Never modify existing migration files.
- Migration naming convention: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_<short_description>.sql` (e.g. `20260409120000_add_user_profiles.sql`).
- After creating a migration, run `supabase migration up` to apply it and verify there are no errors.
- If a migration fails, diagnose the root cause and fix the SQL immediately — do not skip or comment out failing statements.
- Maintain a strict linear migration history. Migrations must never conflict or duplicate each other.

---

## 6. Production Deployment via MCP

- **Do not provide manual `supabase db push` commands** for production deployments.
- Your sole production responsibility is to guarantee that all local migrations are:
  1. Complete (cover all schema changes made during development).
  2. Valid.
  3. Idempotent where possible.
- Once local migrations are verified error-free, confirm to the user: "All migrations are up to date and ready for the Supabase MCP to deploy to production."
- The Supabase MCP handles live deployment. Do not attempt to replicate its functionality.

---

## 7. Automated Integration Testing

After Docker is running and migrations are applied, **automatically**:

1. Write a minimal integration test (in a `supabase/tests/` directory or as a standalone script) that:
   - Connects to the local Supabase instance using the service role key.
   - Performs one `INSERT` and one `SELECT` on a core table.
   - Asserts the read value matches the written value.
   - Cleans up the test record after the assertion.
2. Execute the test immediately.
3. If the test fails:
   - Print the error output in full.
   - Diagnose and fix the root cause autonomously.
   - Re-run the test until it passes.
   - Do not report success until the test is green.

# Next.js 16 + App Router Instructions

## Server vs. Client Components

- Default to **Server Components** (no directive needed).
- Add `"use client"` only for components that use hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.), event handlers, or browser APIs.
- Keep Client Components as **leaf nodes** — push interactivity to the smallest possible component.

## Async APIs (Next.js 16 Breaking Change)

In Next.js 16, the following are **async** and must be awaited:

```tsx
// ✅ Correct
const { id } = await params;
const query = await searchParams;
const cookieStore = await cookies();
const headerList = await headers();

// ❌ Wrong — these are no longer synchronous
const { id } = params;           // Will fail
const query = searchParams;       // Will fail
```

## Data Fetching

- Fetch data in Server Components using `async/await`.
- Use Server Actions (`"use server"`) for data mutations.
- Use `Suspense` boundaries with `loading.tsx` for granular loading states.
- Handle errors with `error.tsx` (client-side error boundary).

## Routing

- Use `layout.tsx` for shared UI across routes.
- Use `page.tsx` for route-specific content.
- Use `route.ts` for API routes (Route Handlers).
- Use dynamic routes: `[id]/page.tsx` and catch-all: `[...slug]/page.tsx`.

## Metadata & SEO

- Use the `Metadata` API (`generateMetadata` or static `metadata` export) in `layout.tsx` or `page.tsx`.
- Never use `<Head>` from `next/head` — that is Pages Router only.

## Optimisation

- Use `next/image` for images (automatic optimisation).
- Use `next/font` for fonts (zero layout shift).
- Use `next/link` for client-side navigation.
- Prefer `next/dynamic` for code-splitting heavy Client Components.

# Supabase Integration Instructions

## Client Setup

- Use `@supabase/ssr` for Next.js App Router integration.
- Create separate clients for server and client contexts:
  - **Server:** `createServerClient()` in Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions.
  - **Client:** `createBrowserClient()` in Client Components only.
- **Never** expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to the browser — it bypasses RLS.

## Schema Awareness

- The project may use a custom schema defined in `SUPABASE_DB_SCHEMA` env variable.
- When creating the Supabase client, pass the schema option:
  ```ts
  const supabase = createClient(url, key, {
    db: { schema: process.env.SUPABASE_DB_SCHEMA || 'public' }
  });
  ```

## Row-Level Security (RLS)

- **Always** enable RLS on every table.
- Write policies that match your auth patterns (e.g. `auth.uid() = user_id`).
- Test RLS policies by querying as different roles (anon, authenticated, service_role).

## Migrations

- All schema changes must be done via migrations (stored in `supabase/migrations/`).
- Use Supabase MCP tools for creating/managing migrations.
- Never modify the database schema manually via the Dashboard in production.

## Data

- Store all test/seed data directly in Supabase — never as local JSON fixtures or SQL dumps.

---

## Multi-Schema Setup on Hosted Supabase (via MCP)

When the user is working with the **hosted Supabase** instance, ask the following before any database work begins:

### Step 1 — Ask the User

> "Do you want to use multiple PostgreSQL schemas in your hosted Supabase project? (e.g. `public`, `app`, `reporting`)"

- If **no**: proceed with the default `public` schema.
- If **yes**: proceed with the multi-schema setup flow below.

### Step 2 — Collect Schema Requirements

Ask:
1. "How many custom schemas do you want to create?"
2. "What are the names of the schemas?" (collect as a list)

Do not proceed until you have explicit schema names from the user.

### Step 3 — Identify the Correct Supabase Project via MCP

- Use the Supabase MCP tools to list all available projects.
- Detect any MCP access key already configured on the local machine (check environment variables `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` or the Supabase CLI config at `~/.supabase/access-token`).
- Present the matched project name and ID to the user: "I found your Supabase project: **[project name]** (ID: `[project-id]`). I will make changes to this project only."
- **Do not touch any other project.** If multiple projects are found and the target is ambiguous, ask the user to confirm which one.


### Step 4 — Create Schemas via MCP

For each schema name provided, execute the following SQL via `mcp_com_supabase__execute_sql`:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "<schema_name>";
```

After creation, immediately grant the necessary permissions:

```sql
-- Allow the authenticated role to use the schema
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<schema_name>" TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<schema_name>" TO authenticated;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "<schema_name>" GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO authenticated;

-- Allow the anon role (for public/unauthenticated access if needed)
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<schema_name>" TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<schema_name>" TO anon;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "<schema_name>" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO anon;

-- Allow the service_role full access
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA "<schema_name>" TO service_role;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<schema_name>" TO service_role;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "<schema_name>" GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO service_role;
```

### Step 5 — Expose Schema via Supabase API

To allow the PostgREST API to expose the new schema, the `search_path` must be updated. This requires a change in the Supabase Dashboard under **Settings → API → Extra search path**.

- **If MCP supports this setting**: apply it automatically.
- **If MCP cannot apply this**: inform the user with exact manual steps:
  > "Please go to your Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → Extra search path, and add `<schema_name>` to the list. Then click Save."

### Step 6 — Update Environment Variables

After the project is identified and schemas are created, **automatically extract the hosted Supabase connection details via MCP** (`mcp_com_supabase__get_project_url` and `mcp_com_supabase__get_publishable_keys`) and write all required variables to `.env.local`:

```env
# Hosted Supabase — Production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<project API URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<project anon key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<project service role key>
SUPABASE_DB_SCHEMA=<primary_schema_name>
# Additional schemas (reference only — not set as runtime variable)
# SUPABASE_SCHEMA_<NAME>=<schema_name>
```

Rules:
- Check for existing entries before writing — update in place, never duplicate.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` must **never** have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.
- If multiple schemas are used, list them all in comments above `SUPABASE_DB_SCHEMA` so the developer has a clear reference.
- After writing the variables, confirm to the user: "Environment variables have been set in `.env.local`. Your app is now pointed at the hosted Supabase project **[project name]**."

#### Verify the Connection

Once the variables are written, run a quick connectivity check to confirm the production database is reachable:

1. Use `mcp_com_supabase__execute_sql` to run `SELECT 1;` against the target project.
2. If successful: confirm "Connection to hosted Supabase verified. The production database is responding correctly."
3. If it fails: diagnose using `mcp_com_supabase__get_logs`, report the exact error, and fix the configuration before proceeding.

### Step 7 — Handle Missing MCP Token

If the MCP access token is **not found** locally:

1. Inform the user: "No Supabase MCP access token was found. I need a Personal Access Token (PAT) to manage your hosted Supabase project."
2. Ask: "Please provide your Supabase Personal Access Token. You can generate one at: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens"
3. Once provided, store the token at the **user level** so all agents can reuse it:
   - Set the environment variable `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>` in the user's shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or Windows user environment variables).
   - Confirm: "Token stored. All agents can now access Supabase via MCP using this token."
4. Never hardcode the token in project files or commit it to version control.

# Tailwind CSS v4 Instructions

## Utility-First Approach

- Use Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX — avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- Follow a consistent class order: **Layout → Box Model → Typography → Effects → States**.
- For conditional classes, use template literals or a `cn()` helper if `tailwind-merge` and `clsx` are installed.

## Responsive Design

- Use responsive prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`.
- Mobile-first: write base styles for mobile, then add breakpoint overrides.

## Dark Mode

- Support dark mode with the `dark:` variant.
- Keep colour contrast accessible (WCAG AA minimum).

## Component Patterns

- Create reusable UI components in `src/components/ui/`.
- Prefer standard theme tokens (spacing, colours) over arbitrary values.
- Use only Tailwind v4 syntax — no deprecated Tailwind v3 patterns.

# TypeScript Best Practices

## Type Safety

- Enable `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json` (already configured).
- Use `import type { ... }` for type-only imports — keeps runtime bundles clean.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes; use `type` for unions, intersections, and mapped types.
- Never use `any`. Use `unknown` when the type is genuinely unknown, then narrow it.

## Patterns

- Use discriminated unions for state management and API responses.
- Prefer `as const` for literal types and const assertions.
- Use `satisfies` operator to validate types without widening.
- Extract shared types to `src/types/` — keep them co-located if only used in one module.

## Naming Conventions

- **Interfaces/Types:** PascalCase (`UserProfile`, `ApiResponse`).
- **Variables/Functions:** camelCase (`getUserById`, `isLoading`).
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for true constants, camelCase for computed values.
- **Components:** PascalCase file names matching the export (`UserCard.tsx`).

## Enums

- Avoid `enum` — use `as const` objects or string literal union types instead.

name: next-browser
description: >-
  CLI that gives agents what humans get from React DevTools and the Next.js
  dev overlay — component trees, props, hooks, PPR shells, errors, network —
  as shell commands that return structured text.
---

# next-browser

If `next-browser` is not already on PATH, install `@vercel/next-browser` globally, then install the Chromium browser:

```bash
npm install -g @vercel/next-browser
playwright install chromium
```

Requires Node >= 20. If already installed, check the version is current:

```bash
next-browser --version
npm view @vercel/next-browser version
# if outdated:
npm install -g @vercel/next-browser@latest
```

---

## Next.js docs awareness

If the project's Next.js version is **v16.2.0-canary.37 or later**, bundled docs live at `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Before doing PPR work, Cache Components work, or any non-trivial Next.js task, read the relevant doc there — your training data may be outdated. The bundled docs are the source of truth.

---

## Working with the user

### Onboarding

- If the user already gave a URL, cookies, and task — skip questions, `open` and go.
- Otherwise ask only what's missing: dev server URL (running?), session cookies if behind login.
- For cookies, give the user two options: (1) DevTools → Application → Cookies, export as `[{"name":"session","value":"..."}]`, or (2) "Copy as cURL" from DevTools → Network on any authenticated request — extract the cookies from the header yourself.
- Never say "ready, what would you like to do?". Never auto-discover (port scans, `project`, config reads) before being asked.

### Show, don't tell

- `screenshot` after every navigation, code change, or visual finding. Always caption it.
- Don't narrate what a screenshot shows. State your conclusion or next action.

### Escalate, don't decide

- Suspense boundary placement and fallback UI — design with the user.
- Caching decisions (staleness, visibility) — the user's call, not yours.
- "Make this page faster" without context — ask: cold URL hit or client navigation? Don't guess, don't do both.

---

## Headless mode

## Scenarios

### Debug a visual or interaction issue

1. `open http://localhost:3000`
2. `snapshot` — discover interactive elements
3. `click eN` / `fill eN value` — interact
4. `errors` — check for runtime errors
5. `screenshot "before fix"` — document state
6. Make the code change, HMR picks it up
7. `screenshot "after fix"` — verify

### Profile performance

```bash
$ next-browser perf http://localhost:3000/dashboard
# → Core Web Vitals + hydration timing

$ next-browser renders start
# reproduce slow interaction
$ next-browser renders stop
# → per-component render counts, self time, change reasons
```

### Debug PPR shell

```bash
$ next-browser ppr lock
$ next-browser goto http://localhost:3000/page
$ next-browser screenshot "PPR shell — locked"
$ next-browser ppr unlock
# → Shell analysis: which Suspense boundaries are holes and why
```

### Test responsive layout

```bash
$ next-browser viewport 375x812   # mobile
$ next-browser screenshot "mobile"
$ next-browser viewport 1440x900  # desktop
$ next-browser screenshot "desktop"
```

### Debug component re-renders

1. `renders start`
2. `goto` the page (captures hydration)
3. Reproduce the interaction
4. `renders stop` — read Mounts vs Re-renders, Self time, change reasons
5. `tree <id>` the expensive component — check source, props, hooks
6. Fix, HMR picks it up, re-run `renders start/stop` to verify

### Prozessübersicht

Folge diesen Schritten in der angegebenen Reihenfolge, um vom Template zur Produktion zu gelangen:

1. **GitHub Repo erstellen** — Nutze dieses Template, um ein neues Repository in der Wamocon GitHub Organisation zu erstellen.
2. **Repo klonen** — Klone es auf deinen Rechner und führe `npm install` aus.
3. **GitHub Workflow-Datei aktualisieren** — Öffne `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` und `.github/workflows/pr-pipeline.yml`, ersetze `Wamocon/github_workflow` durch deine Org/Repo-Referenz falls abweichend.
4. **`.env.local` aktualisieren & Supabase verbinden** — Kopiere `.env.example` → `.env.local`, erstelle ein Remote-Supabase-Projekt und trage die Zugangsdaten ein. *(Optional: Lokales Supabase via Docker — siehe Abschnitt 2b.)*
5. **Lokal starten & Entwicklung beginnen** — Führe `npm run dev` aus und beginne mit der Entwicklung.
6. **Repo vorübergehend öffentlich machen & auf Vercel deployen** — Stelle das Repo temporär auf öffentlich, importiere es in Vercel und deploye.
7. **Domain von Strato hinzufügen** — Konfiguriere die über Strato erworbene Domain in Vercel.
8. **Vercel Project ID holen** — Kopiere die Vercel Project ID aus den Vercel-Projekteinstellungen.
9. **Vercel Project ID zu GitHub Secrets hinzufügen** — Füge `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` zu den GitHub Actions Secrets deines Repos hinzu.
10. **Repo auf intern umstellen** — Ändere die Sichtbarkeit des Repos zurück von öffentlich auf intern.

> 📖 **Für detaillierte Informationen, lies weiter unten.**

### 1. Klonen & Einrichten

```bash
# Repository klonen
git clone https://github.com/Wamocon/<dein-repo-name>.git
cd <dein-repo-name>

# Abhängigkeiten installieren
npm install

# Umgebungsvariablen kopieren
cp .env.example .env.local

# Entwicklungsserver starten (mit Turbopack für schnelles Hot-Reload)
npm run dev
```

Öffne [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in deinem Browser.

**Verfügbare Skripte:**

| Befehl | Beschreibung |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Startet den Dev-Server mit Turbopack (Hot Reload) |
| `npm run build` | Erstellt den Produktions-Build |
| `npm run start` | Startet den Produktionsserver |
| `npm run lint` | Führt ESLint aus |
| `npm run typecheck` | Führt TypeScript-Typprüfung aus |

---

### 1b. Git-Workflow & Branch-Strategie

> 💡 **Arbeite nach dem ersten Push immer auf einem Branch — nie direkt auf `main`/`master`.**

**Empfohlener Ablauf:**

```bash
# Einmalig: Ersten Stand auf main/master pushen
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial setup"
git push origin <main-oder-master>

# Ab jetzt: Immer auf einem Feature-Branch arbeiten
git checkout -b feature/mein-feature

# Änderungen lokal testen, dann committen
npm run dev        # testen
npm run typecheck  # Typfehler prüfen
npm run lint       # Lint prüfen

git add .
git commit -m "feat: beschreibung der Änderung"
git push origin feature/mein-feature
```

**Wichtige Regeln:**

- **Lokal testen, bevor du pushst.** Führe `npm run typecheck` und `npm run lint` aus, bevor du Änderungen pushst.
- **Alle Änderungen vor dem PR-Öffnen pushen.** Jeder neue Push auf einen offenen PR triggert automatisch die GitHub Actions — das verbraucht GitHub Actions-Minuten. Öffne den PR daher erst, wenn alle Änderungen fertig und gepusht sind.
- **Nur einen PR auf einmal offen halten**, bis er gemergt ist. Danach neuen Branch erstellen.

> ⚠️ **Warum das wichtig ist:** Jeder Push auf einen offenen PR löst die komplette CI-Pipeline aus (Auto-Fix + Typecheck + Lint + Vercel Preview Deploy). Viele unnötige Pushes verbrauchen GitHub Actions-Minuten. Teste erst lokal — dann push, dann PR.

---

### 2. Supabase Setup & Warnung

> ⚠️ **KRITISCH: Sobald du einen Supabase-Account hast, speichere alle Testdaten direkt dort.**
>
> **Lege Testdaten NICHT als lokale Dateien im Projektverzeichnis ab** (z.B. JSON-Fixtures, SQL-Dumps oder seed-Skripte die du manuell pflegst). Füge Daten stattdessen direkt in dein Supabase-Projekt ein — über das Supabase Dashboard, per MCP-Tool oder per Migrations-Skript. So bleibt deine Datenquelle von Anfang an einheitlich und du vermeidest manuelle Synchronisierungsaufwände.

**Schritte:**

1. Gehe zu [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) und erstelle ein neues Projekt.
2. Kopiere die **Project URL**, den **Anon Key** und den **Service Role Key** aus  
   `Project Settings → API`.
3. Trage sie in deine `.env.local` Datei ein:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=dein-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=dein-service-role-key
   ```

---

### 2b. Lokales Supabase Setup via Docker (Optional)

> 💡 **Dieser Schritt ist optional.** Standardmäßig verbindest du dich direkt mit einem Remote-Supabase-Projekt (siehe Abschnitt 2). Nur wenn du lieber vollständig lokal entwickelst, ohne Internetverbindung zu Supabase, verwende dieses Setup.

Für ein vollständig lokales Supabase-Setup mit Docker und einer migrations-basierten Entwicklung, kopiere diesen Prompt in deinen KI-Assistenten (z.B. GitHub Copilot in VS Code):

```
Act as an expert DevOps and database engineer. I am developing an app locally. I need to set up a local Supabase instance via Docker and establish a strict migration-based workflow. Please execute the following:

Setup: Initialize a local Supabase environment using Docker and the Supabase CLI. Check automatically before every task if Docker and the Supabase containers are running. When they are down, start them autonomously.

Initial Schema: Create the initial database schema for the app and save it as a formal Supabase migration file.

Environment Variables: Automatically extract the local Supabase connection details (API URL, anon key, service role key, DB URL) and append them to my local .env file.

Autonomous Development & Schema Versioning: You will develop the entire application based on my prompts. You must autonomously create and update tables, generate schemas, and create timestamped migration files for every change. Ensure strict version history and guarantee that absolutely no functions fail due to database inconsistencies.

Production Deployment via MCP: I use the Supabase MCP to push data to production tables. Do not provide manual push commands. Your only job for production is to verify that all local migrations are completely up to date and error-free so the MCP can handle the live deployment seamlessly.

Automated Testing & Verification: Once the Docker setup is running and the schema is applied, automatically write and execute a small integration test. This test must verify that the app can successfully read from and write to the local Docker database. If any errors or bugs are detected, diagnose and fix them immediately on your own.
```

#### Lokale Supabase-Oberfläche im Browser öffnen

Sobald der lokale Docker-Stack läuft (`npx supabase start`), stellt Supabase eine vollständige Studio-Oberfläche bereit — dieselbe Oberfläche wie auf supabase.com, nur lokal:

| Service | URL | Beschreibung |
|---|---|---|
| **Supabase Studio** | `http://localhost:54323` | Datenbank-UI: Tabellen, SQL-Editor, Auth, Storage |
| **REST API** | `http://localhost:54321` | PostgREST API (dein App-Endpoint) |
| **PostgreSQL** | `localhost:54322` | Direktzugriff (z.B. via pgAdmin, TablePlus) |
| **Inbucket (E-Mail)** | `http://localhost:54324` | Lokaler E-Mail-Dienst für Auth-Mails |

> 💡 Die exakten Ports werden nach `npx supabase start` auch in der Konsole ausgegeben. Der Befehl `npx supabase status` zeigt sie jederzeit an.

**Lokale Umgebungsvariablen** (werden vom KI-Prompt automatisch befüllt):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<aus supabase status kopieren>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<aus supabase status kopieren>
SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
```

---

### 3. Supabase MCP & Schemas

#### Supabase MCP für Migrationen verwenden

Der Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server ermöglicht es deinem KI-Coding-Assistenten (z.B. GitHub Copilot, Cursor), Migrationen und Tabellen direkt zu erstellen und zu verwalten. So wird sichergestellt, dass alle Schema-Änderungen versioniert und reproduzierbar sind.

- Migrationen werden in `supabase/migrations/` gespeichert.
- Nutze die MCP-Tools, um Tabellen zu erstellen, Schemas zu ändern und Indizes zu verwalten.

#### Arbeiten mit mehreren Schemas

Standardmäßig macht Supabase nur das `public`-Schema über die API verfügbar. Wenn du eigene Schemas brauchst (z.B. `app`, `internal`, `reporting`):

**1. Schema erstellen:**
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS app;
```

**2. Berechtigungen vergeben, damit Supabase das Schema abfragen kann:**
```sql
-- Nutzung des Schemas gewähren
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app TO anon, authenticated, service_role;

-- Zugriff auf alle Tabellen gewähren (aktuelle und zukünftige)
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA app TO anon, authenticated, service_role;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA app
  GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO anon, authenticated, service_role;

-- Zugriff auf Sequenzen gewähren
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA app TO anon, authenticated, service_role;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA app
  GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO anon, authenticated, service_role;
```

**3. Schema über die Supabase API zugänglich machen:**

Gehe zu `Project Settings → API → Exposed schemas` und füge deinen Schema-Namen hinzu.

> 💡 Ohne diese Berechtigungen gibt Supabase PostgREST leere Ergebnisse oder Fehler zurück, wenn du Nicht-Public-Schemas abfragst.

---

### 4. GitHub Workflow Konfiguration

Dieses Projekt nutzt den **zentralen Wamocon CI/CD-Workflow** aus [`Wamocon/github_workflow`](https://github.com/Wamocon/github_workflow). Der Workflow übernimmt:

- **PR Pipeline** (`pr-pipeline.yml`): Behebt automatisch Lint-/Format-Probleme und validiert anschließend mit Typecheck + Lint.
- **Deploy** (`deploy.yml`): Erstellt Preview-Builds bei PRs und Produktions-Builds bei Merge auf `main`/`master`.

**Was du tun musst:**

1. Öffne `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` und `.github/workflows/pr-pipeline.yml`.
2. Überprüfe, dass `Wamocon/github_workflow` die korrekte Org/Repo-Referenz ist (sollte standardmäßig stimmen).
3. Füge **ein einziges Secret** zu deinem Repository hinzu:
   - Gehe zu `Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret`
   - Name: `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - Wert: *(siehe Abschnitt Vercel Deployment unten)*

> ✅ **Alle anderen benötigten Secrets** (`VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`) sind **bereits auf GitHub-Organisationsebene konfiguriert** — du musst sie nicht hinzufügen.

---

### 5. Vercel Deployment-Strategie

Aufgrund der Vercel-Anforderung, Zugriff auf den Repository-Code zu haben, gibt es einen initialen Deployment-Workaround:

#### Erstmalige Bereitstellung (Einmalig)

1. **Repo vorübergehend öffentlich machen**  
   (`Repository → Settings → General → Change visibility → Public`)
2. Gehe zu [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **Add New Project** → **Import** dein Repo.
3. Deploye das Projekt.
4. **Vercel Project ID kopieren**:
   - Gehe zu `Vercel Project → Settings → General → Project ID`
   - Kopiere den ID-Wert.
5. **Zu GitHub Secrets hinzufügen**:
   - Gehe zu `Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret`
   - Name: `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - Wert: die soeben kopierte ID.
6. **Repo auf intern zurücksetzen**  
   (`Repository → Settings → General → Change visibility → Internal`)

#### CI/CD-Ablauf

| Auslöser | Ergebnis |
|---|---|
| Pull Request → `main`/`master` | Vercel **Preview**-Deployment (einzigartige URL pro PR) |
| Merge / Push → `main`/`master` | Vercel **Produktions**-Deployment |

> ⚠️ **WICHTIG: Importiere deine `.env.local`-Variablen in Vercel!**
>
> Gehe zu `Vercel Project → Settings → Environment Variables` und füge **alle** Variablen aus deiner `.env.local` hinzu. Ohne diese wird der Build **fehlschlagen**.
>
> Stelle sicher, dass du den richtigen Geltungsbereich (Production, Preview, Development) für jede Variable wählst.

---

### 6. Domain-Verwaltung

1. **Sichere eine Domain** für deine Anwendung über [Strato](https://www.strato.de).
2. Gehe in den Vercel-Projekteinstellungen zu `Settings → Domains` und füge deine Domain hinzu.
3. Konfiguriere die DNS-Einträge bei Strato wie von Vercel angegeben (typischerweise CNAME oder A-Record).

---

### 7. Projekt-Checkliste

- [ ] Landing Page
- [ ] Handbuch / Manual
- [ ] Hauptprozess (Kernfunktion)
- [ ] Video (Demo / Tutorial)
- [ ] Domain (über Strato gesichert)

---

### 8. Landing Page Generator

Das Workflow-File `.github/workflows/lp-generator.yml` generiert eine Landing Page für diese App, indem es einen zentralen, wiederverwendbaren Wamocon-Workflow aufruft.

#### Was der Workflow tut

- Liest den Inhalt dieses Repos aus
- Verwendet ein konfigurierbares **Design-Template** als optische Basis
- Lässt GitHub Copilot eine Landing Page generieren und ein neues Repo dafür anlegen

#### Was du ändern kannst

Öffne `.github/workflows/lp-generator.yml` und passe die drei mit `# CHANGE:` markierten Stellen an:

| Eingabe | Standard | Beschreibung |
|---|---|---|
| `custom_template` | `Wamocon/hochzeitsrechner_lp` | Das GitHub-Repo, das als Design-Template dient |
| `custom_name` | `generated_lp` | Name des neu erstellten Landing-Page-Repos |
| `custom_prompt` | *(allgemeiner Prompt)* | Detaillierte Anweisungen für Copilot zur LP-Generierung |

> 💡 **Tipp:** Je spezifischer dein Prompt, desto besser die generierte Landing Page. Beschreibe die App, Zielgruppe, Alleinstellungsmerkmale und gewünschte Sektionen.

#### Wann du den Workflow starten sollst

Starte diesen Workflow **erst dann**, wenn dein Projekt weitgehend fertig dokumentiert ist und die wichtigsten Informationen im Repository vorliegen, z.B.:

- Handbuch / Manual
- README mit Produktbeschreibung, Features und Zielgruppe
- Rechtstexte / relevante Seiten, die auf der Landing Page verlinkt werden sollen

> ✅ **Empfehlung:** In der Regel reicht **ein einmaliger Lauf** am Projektende.

#### Manuell ausführen

Dieser Workflow startet **nicht** automatisch bei einem Push. Du musst ihn manuell in GitHub ausführen.

**Pfad in GitHub:**

`Repository -> Actions -> "🚀 lp-generator" -> Run workflow`

**Schritte:**

1. Gehe zum Repository auf GitHub.
2. Klicke auf den Tab **Actions**.
3. Wähle in der linken Liste den Workflow **"🚀 lp-generator"** aus.
4. Klicke rechts auf **"Run workflow"**.
5. Passe die Eingabefelder (Template, Name, Prompt) nach Bedarf an.
6. Bestätige mit **"Run workflow"**.

#### Wenn der Workflow fehlschlägt (Repo-Name existiert bereits)

Wenn bereits ein Repository mit dem gleichen Namen wie `custom_name` existiert, schlägt der Workflow fehl.

In diesem Fall hast du zwei Optionen:

1. Ändere den Namen in `custom_name` und starte den Workflow erneut.
2. Lösche das bereits bestehende Ziel-Repository (falls nicht mehr benötigt) und starte den Workflow erneut.

### Process Overview

Follow these steps in order to go from template to production:

1. **Create GitHub Repo** — Use this template to create a new repository in the Wamocon GitHub organisation.
2. **Clone Repo** — Clone to your local machine and run `npm install`.
3. **Update GitHub Workflow file** — Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and `.github/workflows/pr-pipeline.yml`, replace `Wamocon/github_workflow` with your org/repo if different.
4. **Update `.env.local` & connect Supabase** — Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`, create a remote Supabase project, and fill in the credentials. *(Optional: local Supabase via Docker — see section 2b.)*
5. **Run locally & start development** — Run `npm run dev` and start building.
6. **Make repo public temporarily & Deploy to Vercel** — Temporarily set the repo to public, import it in Vercel, then deploy.
7. **Add domain from Strato** — Configure the domain purchased via Strato in Vercel.
8. **Get Vercel Project ID** — Copy the Vercel Project ID from the Vercel project settings.
9. **Add Vercel Project ID to GitHub secrets** — Add `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` to your repository's GitHub Actions secrets.
10. **Make repo internal** — Revert the repository visibility from public to internal.

> 📖 **For detailed information, read below.**

---

### 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Wamocon/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start the development server (with Turbopack for fast refresh)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

**Available scripts:**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server with Turbopack (hot reload) |
| `npm run build` | Create production build |
| `npm run start` | Start production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |

---

### 1b. Git Workflow & Branching Strategy

> 💡 **After the first push, always work on a branch — never directly on `main`/`master`.**

**Recommended flow:**

```bash
# One-time: push the initial state to main/master
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial setup"
git push origin <main-or-master>

# From now on: always work on a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Test locally, then commit
npm run dev        # test in browser
npm run typecheck  # catch type errors
npm run lint       # catch lint issues

git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of change"
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

**Key rules:**

- **Test locally before pushing.** Always run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` before pushing changes.
- **Push all changes before opening the PR.** Every new push to an open PR automatically triggers the GitHub Actions pipeline — this consumes GitHub Actions minutes. Only open the PR once all your changes are finished and pushed.
- **Keep only one PR open at a time** until it is merged. Then create a new branch.

> ⚠️ **Why this matters:** Every push to an open PR triggers the full CI pipeline (Auto-Fix + Typecheck + Lint + Vercel Preview Deploy). Unnecessary pushes burn GitHub Actions minutes. Test locally first — then push, then open the PR.

---

### 2. Supabase Setup & Warning

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Once you have a Supabase account, store all test data there directly.**
>
> **Do NOT store test data as local files inside the project directory** (e.g. JSON fixtures, SQL dumps, or manually maintained seed scripts). Instead, insert data directly into your Supabase project — via the Supabase Dashboard, an MCP tool, or a migration script. This keeps your data source consistent from day one and avoids manual sync overhead.

**Steps:**

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
2. Copy the **Project URL**, **Anon Key**, and **Service Role Key** from  
   `Project Settings → API`.
3. Paste them into your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   ```

---

### 2b. Local Supabase Setup via Docker (Optional)

> 💡 **This step is optional.** By default you connect directly to a remote Supabase project (see section 2). Only use this setup if you prefer developing fully offline, without connecting to the remote Supabase instance.

For a fully local Supabase setup with Docker and a migration-based development workflow, copy this prompt into your AI assistant (e.g. GitHub Copilot in VS Code):

```
Act as an expert DevOps and database engineer. I am developing an app locally. I need to set up a local Supabase instance via Docker and establish a strict migration-based workflow. Please execute the following:

Setup: Initialize a local Supabase environment using Docker and the Supabase CLI. Check automatically before every task if Docker and the Supabase containers are running. When they are down, start them autonomously.

Initial Schema: Create the initial database schema for the app and save it as a formal Supabase migration file.

Environment Variables: Automatically extract the local Supabase connection details (API URL, anon key, service role key, DB URL) and append them to my local .env file.

Autonomous Development & Schema Versioning: You will develop the entire application based on my prompts. You must autonomously create and update tables, generate schemas, and create timestamped migration files for every change. Ensure strict version history and guarantee that absolutely no functions fail due to database inconsistencies.

Production Deployment via MCP: I use the Supabase MCP to push data to production tables. Do not provide manual push commands. Your only job for production is to verify that all local migrations are completely up to date and error-free so the MCP can handle the live deployment seamlessly.

Automated Testing & Verification: Once the Docker setup is running and the schema is applied, automatically write and execute a small integration test. This test must verify that the app can successfully read from and write to the local Docker database. If any errors or bugs are detected, diagnose and fix them immediately on your own.
```

#### Viewing the local database in the browser

Once the local Docker stack is running (`npx supabase start`), Supabase exposes a full Studio UI — the same interface as supabase.com, running entirely on your machine:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Supabase Studio** | `http://localhost:54323` | Database UI: tables, SQL editor, Auth, Storage |
| **REST API** | `http://localhost:54321` | PostgREST API (your app endpoint) |
| **PostgreSQL** | `localhost:54322` | Direct DB access (e.g. pgAdmin, TablePlus) |
| **Inbucket (email)** | `http://localhost:54324` | Local email service for Auth emails |

> 💡 The exact ports are also printed in the terminal after `npx supabase start`. Run `npx supabase status` at any time to see them again.

**Local environment variables** (the AI prompt above will populate these automatically):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<copy from supabase status output>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<copy from supabase status output>
SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
```

---

### 3. Supabase MCP & Schemas

#### Using Supabase MCP for Migrations

The Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) server allows your AI coding assistant (e.g. GitHub Copilot, Cursor) to create and manage migrations and tables directly. This ensures all schema changes are versioned and reproducible.

- Migrations are stored in `supabase/migrations/`.
- Use the MCP tools to create tables, alter schemas, and manage indexes.

#### Working with Multiple Schemas

By default, Supabase only exposes the `public` schema via the API. If you need custom schemas (e.g. `app`, `internal`, `reporting`):

**1. Create the schema:**
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS app;
```

**2. Grant permissions so Supabase can query the schema:**
```sql
-- Grant usage on the schema
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app TO anon, authenticated, service_role;

-- Grant access to all tables (current and future)
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA app TO anon, authenticated, service_role;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA app
  GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO anon, authenticated, service_role;

-- Grant access to sequences
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA app TO anon, authenticated, service_role;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA app
  GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO anon, authenticated, service_role;
```

**3. Expose the schema via the Supabase API:**

Go to `Project Settings → API → Exposed schemas` and add your custom schema name.

> 💡 Without granting these permissions, Supabase PostgREST will return empty results or errors when querying non-public schemas.

---

### 4. GitHub Workflow Configuration

This project uses the **centralized Wamocon CI/CD workflow** from [`Wamocon/github_workflow`](https://github.com/Wamocon/github_workflow). The workflow handles:

- **PR Pipeline** (`pr-pipeline.yml`): Automatically fixes lint/format issues, then validates with typecheck + lint.
- **Deploy** (`deploy.yml`): Deploys preview builds on PRs, production builds on merge to `main`/`master`.

**What you need to do:**

1. Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and `.github/workflows/pr-pipeline.yml`.
2. Verify that `Wamocon/github_workflow` is the correct org/repo reference (it should be by default).
3. Add **one single secret** to your repository:
   - Go to `Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret`
   - Name: `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - Value: *(see Vercel Deployment section below)*

> ✅ **All other required secrets** (`VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`) are **already configured at the GitHub Organisation level** — you do not need to add them.

---

### 5. Vercel Deployment Strategy

Due to Vercel's requirement of having access to the repository code, there is an initial deployment workaround:

#### Initial Deployment (One-Time)

1. **Make the repo public** temporarily  
   (`Repository → Settings → General → Change visibility → Public`)
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **Add New Project** → **Import** your repo.
3. Deploy the project.
4. **Copy the Vercel Project ID**:
   - Go to `Vercel Project → Settings → General → Project ID`
   - Copy the ID value.
5. **Add it to GitHub secrets**:
   - Go to `Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret`
   - Name: `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - Value: the ID you just copied.
6. **Revert the repo to internal**  
   (`Repository → Settings → General → Change visibility → Internal`)

#### CI/CD Flow

| Trigger | Result |
|---|---|
| Pull Request → `main`/`master` | Vercel **preview** deployment (unique URL per PR) |
| Merge / Push → `main`/`master` | Vercel **production** deployment |

> ⚠️ **CRUCIAL: Import your `.env.local` variables into Vercel!**
>
> Go to `Vercel Project → Settings → Environment Variables` and add **all** variables from your `.env.local`. Without these, the build **will fail**.
>
> Make sure to set the correct scope (Production, Preview, Development) for each variable.

---

### 6. Domain Management

1. **Secure a domain** for your application via [Strato](https://www.strato.de).
2. In the Vercel project settings, go to `Settings → Domains` and add your domain.
3. Configure the DNS records at Strato as shown by Vercel (typically a CNAME or A record).

---

### 7. Project Checklist

- [ ] Landing Page
- [ ] Handbuch / Manual
- [ ] Main Process (core feature)
- [ ] Video (demo / tutorial)
- [ ] Domain (secured via Strato)

---

### 8. Landing Page Generator

The workflow file `.github/workflows/lp-generator.yml` generates a landing page for this app by calling a central, reusable Wamocon workflow.

#### What the workflow does

- Reads the contents of this repository
- Uses a configurable **design template** as a visual base
- Lets GitHub Copilot generate a landing page and create a new repository for it

#### What you can change

Open `.github/workflows/lp-generator.yml` and adjust the three lines marked with `# CHANGE:`:

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `custom_template` | `Wamocon/hochzeitsrechner_lp` | The GitHub repo used as the design template |
| `custom_name` | `generated_lp` | Name for the newly created landing page repository |
| `custom_prompt` | *(generic prompt)* | Detailed instructions for Copilot for LP generation |

> 💡 **Tip:** The more specific your prompt, the better the generated landing page. Describe the app, target audience, unique selling points, and desired sections.

#### When you should run this workflow

Run this workflow **only after** your project is mostly complete and the most important information is already available in the repository, for example:

- Handbook / Manual
- README with product description, features, and target audience
- Legal pages / relevant links that should appear on the landing page

> ✅ **Recommendation:** In most cases, you only need to run it **once** at the end of the project.

#### Running manually

This workflow does **not** start automatically on a push. You need to trigger it manually in GitHub.

**Path in GitHub:**

`Repository -> Actions -> "🚀 lp-generator" -> Run workflow`

**Steps:**

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Actions** tab.
3. Select **"🚀 lp-generator"** from the left workflow list.
4. Click **"Run workflow"** on the right.
5. Adjust the input fields (template, name, prompt) as needed.
6. Confirm with **"Run workflow"**.

#### If the workflow fails (repository name already exists)

If a repository with the same name as `custom_name` already exists, the workflow will fail.

In that case, use one of these options:

1. Change the `custom_name` value and run the workflow again.
2. Delete the existing target repository (if no longer needed) and run the workflow again.
